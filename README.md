# rapid-roll
C++-Implementation of the old Nokia mobile game 'Rapid Roll'

This was a project for the university class 'Programming in C++'.

The game was created and run on LINUX, consider this when trying to compile and execute
(See Makefile -> install and LIBRARIES for linked libraries).

OpenGLTerminalManager.* files were created by a tutor for the students to use (see copyright header)
and modified by me (made alterations include activating the three rgb-channels instead of originally
only one channel for red colour).

Although making this game was great fun, it is probably far from perfect in terms of efficiency / performance
and modularity & readability.

For a tutorial on how to play RapidRoll, run the Main file and pay attention to text in the terminal ;)
